# CSS Advanced Project

## Overview
This project is about a SmileSchool website and is build up from the advanced HTML project. Here, we apply all the knowledge gained from HTM and CSS modules in the ALX front-end development course.

The project also aims to connect UI Design wireframing based on a Figma file with HTML and ultimately CSS.

We will be adding color, fonts, element positioning using CSS and embedding images and videos in the file to make it visually dynamic.

#### HTML Semantics
